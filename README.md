## Main Files

- **affine_cypher.py** — contains the affine cipher logic and helper functions
- **gui.py** — provides the graphical interface for user interaction
- **main.py** — allows you to launch the GUI by running `python main.py`

## How to Run
```bash
git clone https://github.com/adamstefanik/affine_cipher.git
cd affine_cipher
```
2. Start the main file
```
python main.py
```
3. (If you are on Linux and get an error about Tkinter, install it via  
`sudo apt install python3-tk`.)
