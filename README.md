# Affine Cipher GUI

A simple Python application for encrypting and decrypting text using the affine cipher algorithm.  
The project features an easy-to-use graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter, allowing users to input text, set cipher keys, and view results instantly.

## Files

- **affine_cypher.py** — contains the affine cipher logic and helper functions
- **gui.py** — provides the graphical interface for user interaction
- **main.py** — allows you to launch the GUI by running `python main.py`

## How to Run
1. Start the main file
   ```
   python main.py
   ```
3. (If you are on Linux and get an error about Tkinter, install it via  
   `sudo apt install python3-tk`.)
